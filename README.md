# Evades Clone
This is a fork of https://ravel.turudu.repl.co/ with support for enemy modifiers (count, speed, radius). Go to the [website](https://thqrn.github.io/evades-clone/) (https://thqrn.github.io/evades-clone/) and add modifiers at the end of the url like so:

https://thqrn.github.io/evades-clone/?rm=2&sm=1.2&cm=0.5

## Modifiers
rm = radius multiplier (radius of enemies)
sm = speed multiplier (movement speed of enemies)
cm = count multiplier (amount of enemies)
